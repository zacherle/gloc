GLoc in an adaptation of NonLinLoc.

NonLinLoc is a set of programs for locating earthquakes in 3D structures and for visualizing location results.
You can find everything about this original program at [A. Lomax website](http://alomax.free.fr/nlloc/).

These github pages are part of the [gloc repository](https://github.com/zacherle/gloc).   
Here you will find notes on working with this program. 
Mostly in Czech.
